# iDesign Preview Theme

A simple Markdown preview theme for [Inkdrop](https://www.inkdrop.app/).

I love simple design of inkdrop. I just wanted to add more colors to the preview markdown that look like MacOS.
I made this theme for my own use. But I'll publish it on the store when finished if users are interested.
This preview theme is build to work with `Vibrant Dark UI` and the `acrylic transclucent` background option with dark mode system enabled.
