# iDesign Preview Theme

A simple Markdown preview theme for [Inkdrop](https://www.inkdrop.app/).

I love simple design of inkdrop. I just want to add more color to the preview markdown that looked and felt native on MacOS.
I edit the theme for my personal use, but upload it if interest someone.
This preview theme is build to work with `Vibrant Dark UI` and the acrylic transclucent background option with dark mode system enabled.

With iDesign theme :
